        help
            Enable support for BME680/BME688 environmental sensors using
            Bosch BSEC 2.x library.

            This requires the proprietary BSEC library to be installed.
            See components/bsec/README.md for setup instructions.

            If disabled, the firmware will only support ambient light sensors
            (VEML7700/OPT4001) and will build without BSEC dependencies.

            I2C address of the BME680/BME688 sensor.

            Default: 0x76 (SDO pin low)
            Alternate: 0x77 (SDO pin high)

        help
            How often to read the BME680 sensor (in seconds).

            Recommended: 3 seconds (balances accuracy with power consumption)
            BSEC requires regular sampling for accurate air quality calculation.

        help
            How often to save BSEC calibration state to NVS (in hours).

            BSEC learns air quality baselines over time. Saving state
            preserves calibration across reboots.

            Recommended: 4 hours (balances wear leveling with state freshness)
